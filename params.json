I did my undergraduate work in Mathematics at Dalian University of Technology. My hobbies are quantitative finance and data analysis.\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n* University of Michigan\r\n\r\nMaster of Science in Quantitative Finance & Risk Management, Major GPA: 4.0\r\n\r\nCourses: Numerical Methods with Financial Applications, Discrete State Stochastic Processes, Stochastic Analysis for\r\nFinance, Financial Mathematics, Applied Statistics, Machine Learning, Applied Microeconomics\r\n* Dalian University of Technology Dalian, China \r\n\r\nBachelor of Science in Mathematics, Major GPA: 3.7 Sep. 2011 - Jun. 2015 \r\n\r\nCourses: Mathematical Analysis, Advanced Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations, Functions of Complex Variables,\r\nFunctions of Real Variables, Probability and Statistics, Functional Analysis, Stochastic Process, Optimization Method, Calculation Method, Probability and Measure, Optimal Control\r\n\r\n### Recently Work\r\nCurrently, in my work as a research assistant to Dr. Nejat Seyhun, Professor of Finance at the UM, I am responsible for banking data analysis. I extracted big data on financial securities and transactions from a number of commercial banks onto Excel spread sheets, organized transaction data in Excel in preparation for dataâ€™s integration into SAS. Thus, we can analyze indexes of banking transactions that concern LIBOR rates that are either missing or in correct and create a new file on Excel to include the particular transactions with problem using SAS. In addition, I conduct interest-paid computations on a variety of banking instruments, such as bonds, loans, and annuities using R and Python software. These applications allow me to analyze and prepare large data sets for clear and concise presentation for publication in refereed academic journals. In completing these duties, I remain committed, diligent and self-motivated in getting the job done efficiently and accurately.",
