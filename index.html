<p>Currently, in my work as a research assistant to Dr. Nejat Seyhun, Professor of Finance at the UM, I am responsible for banking data analysis. I extracted big data on financial securities and transactions from a number of commercial banks onto Excel spread sheets, organized transaction data in Excel in preparation for dataâ€™s integration into SAS. Thus, we can analyze indexes of banking transactions that concern LIBOR rates that are either missing or in correct and create a new file on Excel to include the particular transactions with problem using SAS. In addition, I conduct interest-paid computations on a variety of banking instruments, such as bonds, loans, and annuities using R and Python software. These applications allow me to analyze and prepare large data sets for clear and concise presentation for publication in refereed academic journals. In completing these duties, I remain committed, diligent and self-motivated in getting the job done efficiently and accurately.</p>
