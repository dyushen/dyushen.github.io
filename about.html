       <h1>About this project</h1>
       <p>This project is a Basic Data-Driven Visualization with D3 for the dataset Slate Gun Death.
       The website includes two parts: the left map panel and the right information panel.
       For the left map, the color reflects the total death number of each states and the colored dots indicate the location of each death with gender information.
       Above the map, we also provide a function to filter the gender.
       If you hover any state, a tooltip will show the exact death number of the state and for each gender. You may also see a box plot for the age on the toolip.
       You can also click on each state and the map will zoom in on the state. Hovering the state after zooming in will show death information of top cities on the tootip.
       At the same time, the right inforamtion panel will show the age information for the top cities.
