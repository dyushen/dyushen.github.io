            <p>I am a Ph.D. student at University of Illinois at Chicago, MSCS (Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science) department. I got my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the Dalian University of Technolody, China. Then I came to US and got my Master's degree in Quantitative Finance & Risk Management at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Then I found that I really interested in algorithms and decided to continue to pursue a Ph.D. degree. And I came to UIC in 2017 and my current major is Statistics.</p>
            <p>I was born in Tianjin, China, a beatiful coastal city. I like watching movie during my spare time and cartoon is my favorite type. Recently, I am exploring some classic suspense movies and Shutter Island is my favourite for now. I also like visiting museums and parks. The botanic garden is my favourite place in Chicago.</p>
